  Given the following information, provide suggestions for driver assignments and re-assignments.

  Available Drivers:
  {{#each availableDrivers}}
  - Driver ID: {{{driverId}}}, Current Location: {{{currentLocation}}}, Availability: {{{availabilityStatus}}}
  {{/each}}

  Pending Ride Requests:
  {{#each pendingRideRequests}}
  - Request ID: {{{requestId}}}, Pickup: {{{pickupLocation}}}, Dropoff: {{{dropoffLocation}}}, Passengers: {{{passengerCount}}}{{#if movingFee}}, Moving Fee{{/if}}{{#if scheduledTime}}, Scheduled: {{{scheduledTime}}}{{/if}}
  {{/each}}

  Consider factors such as driver proximity to pickup locations, estimated travel times, driver availability, passenger count, and any special conditions like moving fees or scheduled times when making your suggestions.

  Provide your suggestions in the following format:
  {
    "driverAssignmentSuggestions": [
      {
        "driverId": "driver123",
        "rideRequestId": "request456",
        "reason": "Driver is closest to the passenger pickup location and is available."
      }
    ],
    "driverReassignmentSuggestions": [
      {
        "driverId": "driver789",
        "newRideRequestId": "request101",
        "reason": "Reassigning driver to a higher priority request closer to their current location."
      }
    ]
  }

  Ensure that your suggestions are clear, concise, and actionable.  If there are no suggestions to make, return empty lists for both driverAssignmentSuggestions and driverReassignmentSuggestions.
