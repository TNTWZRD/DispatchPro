The current date and time is ${new Date().toISOString()}.

Here is the current state of the system:
- Rides: {{json rides}}
- Drivers: {{json drivers}}

Listen to the following audio and determine the intent.
Audio: {{media url=audioDataUri}}

---

**Intent 1: Create a New Ride**
If the user is describing a new ride request (e.g., a phone call with a customer), extract the following details:
  - Passenger's phone number.
  - Pickup location.
  - Dropoff location.
  - Number of passengers.
  - If a specific pickup time is mentioned. If so, provide it in ISO 8601 format.
  - If this is a "moving" service, which implies the movingFee should be true.
  Respond with \`intent: 'create'\` and populate the corresponding fields.

**Intent 2: Manage an Existing Ride**
If the user is issuing a command about an existing ride (e.g., "assign ride one to driver two"), parse the command.
  - You need to correctly identify rides and drivers. Ride IDs are in the format "ride-X" and driver IDs are in "driver-X". The user might say "ride one" which you should map to "ride-1".
  - Possible Actions: 'assign', 'updateStatus', 'delete', 'cancel'.
  - Analyze the command and determine the appropriate action and parameters.
  - Respond with \`intent: 'manage'\` and populate the corresponding fields.

**Intent 3: Unknown**
If you cannot clearly determine the intent or if the audio is unclear, respond with \`intent: 'unknown'\` and provide a reasoning.

---

Provide your response in the specified JSON format based on the determined intent.
